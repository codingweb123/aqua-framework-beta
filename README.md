### Templates syntax (I hope this framework helped someone)
> {{ $variable }} - replacing your variable from controller

> **\<x-content></x-content>** - return slot content

> **\<x-content /> ** - will work too

> **\<x-component name="layout" relate="config"></x-component>** - using view as component (relate is not important to add)

> **\<x-component name="layout" />** - will work too

### That's it!
